# simple-spark-testing-library

A small library designed to be a wrapper for unit and integration tests. Tailored for Spark 1.6 only.

Unit tests with ScalaTest, and integration tests with Cucumber (in the future).

Make use of the hot trends of TDD and BDD that are sometimes overlooked in Spark applications!
